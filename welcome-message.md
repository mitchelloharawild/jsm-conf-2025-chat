Hello! Welcome to **posit::conf(2025)**! 🎉 I'm a chat bot designed to help you find information about the sessions at this year's conference. If you have any questions about the sessions or speakers, feel free to ask. It uses agenda data from the conference website. If you get an error, you might be rate limited, so please refresh your page and try again in a minute or two.

Here are some examples:
- 'Are there any sessions about causal inference?'
- 'What talks is Hadley giving this year?'
- 'I'm interested in learning about LLMs, what sessions should I attend?'

Let's get started! Type your question below, and I'll do my best to assist you. 😊
